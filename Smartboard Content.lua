- If you hold the same rank to another soldier then they must be addressed by their rank.
---------------------------------------
- The standard uniform that you are required to wear at all times on base are OCPs, along with the Patrol Cover that corresponds with your rank. 

- The only times you would not be required to be wearing an OCP or Patrol Cover would be if you are attending a PT or you are inside.

-Army Green Service Uniforms are to be worn for formal events such as inspections, classroom sessions, and graduations. 

- Just like the OCPâ€™s, you are required to wear the Army Service uniform and cap that correspond with your rank.

-When on base, you should explicitly only be wearing an OCP, Patrol Cover, and eyewear that meets the standards outlined in the UCMJ.
